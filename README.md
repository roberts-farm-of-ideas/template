## This idea in {number-of-characters} characters
It's good to have a template for multiple related things.

## How to Use

## About this Farm of Ideas
[This "Farm of Ideas"](https://github.com/roberts-farm-of-ideas) is supposed to store ideas I would like to develop into scientific progress some day, and to store their progression from initial idea being had, over keeping them alive, to growing them into something real and then "harvesting". 

If you are faster in developing them, I am happy with you and for the world! :) Just to avoid me having spend time on something you already realized then, I would be grateful for a short letting-me-know email.

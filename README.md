## This idea in {number-of-characters} characters
It's good to have a template for multiple related things.

## How to Use
You are free to use this idea in whatever way you like. I put this material under CC-BY license, just to make it legally clear, but: "Gedanken sind frei" (ideas are free) -- I don't expect them to be protectable anyway.

I use this repository to store ideas I would like to develop into scientific progress some day. If you are faster in developing them, I am happy with you and for the world! :) Just to avoid me having spend time on something you already realized then, I would be grateful for a short letting-me-know email.

## About this farm of ideas
This farm of ideas is supposed to store the progression of initial ideas being had, over keeping them alive, to growing them into something real and then "harvesting". Whatever that means...
